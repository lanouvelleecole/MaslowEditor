In the previous code you just generated, fix those 2 things:source = the source code of filePath

latestFuncIndex = 0

found = true

basket = []

as long as found is true, do the following:

latestFuncIndex = the first index of any of the following strings, 
inside source, starting at index latestFuncIndex:

'\n(optional export statement) (optional async statement) function (valid function name)(' (with a regex)
'\n(optional export statement) (const or var or let) (valid function name) = (optional async statement) (' (with another separate regex)

if latestFuncIndex is found, do the following:

latestFuncEndIndex = the first index of '\n}', in source, starting from latestFuncIndex.

if latestFuncEndIndex > latestFuncIndex, then latestFuncEndIndex += 3,
then add to basket the substring starting at latestFuncIndex, and ending at latestFuncEndIndex + 3,
then latestFuncIndex = latestFuncEndIndex, then keep moving.


if latestFuncIndex is not found, then found = false.

Once all that is done, return basket. If an error takes places, return basket.

In the latest generated code you made, you forgot about one of the regexes. fix this
